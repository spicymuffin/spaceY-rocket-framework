rewrite existing codebase to match new hardware
    stuff that probably wont work:
        clock:
            investigate microsecond timers
        data storage:
            pending, depends on selected data storage method
            (probably usb: use this library https://github.com/rppicomidi/pico-usb-host-msc-demo)
        misc coding stuff:
            utility:
                strftime, format all dont work, rewrite libs from the ground up for utility
            io and debugging:
                iostream doenst work, find new ways to write data
        comms:
            1: (use old comms module) send stuff, through uart, it just works out of the box basically
            2: (use new comms module) need to write new library ig
        sensors:
            accel, gyro, ang accel, temp, altimeter
        motors:
            servo: parachute open on
