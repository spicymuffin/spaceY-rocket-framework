// I2Cdev library collection
// Raspberry Pi Pico port for: MPU6050 I2C device class, 6-axis MotionApps 6.12 implementation
// Based on InvenSense MPU-6050 register map document rev. 2.0, 5/19/2011 (RM-MPU-6000A-00)
// 5/20/2013 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
// Updates should (hopefully) always be available at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
//
// Changelog:
// 2021-09-29 - Initial port release by Gino Ip√≥liti.
// 2019/7/10 - I incorporated DMP Firmware Version 6.12 Latest as of today with many features and bug fixes.
//           - MPU6050 Registers have not changed just the DMP Image so that full backwards compatibility is present
//           - Run-time calibration routine is enabled which calibrates after no motion state is detected
//           - once no motion state is detected Calibration completes within 0.5 seconds
//           - The Drawback is that the firmware image is larger.
//     ... - ongoing debug release
